    Every one of us leads our lives in such a way that we can be an example in history for the future generation. We want to be the person who is looked upon in society for our good deeds. 
    Much like us dogs the best friends of the human kind like living a purposeful life. Every dog wants to serve his master till death.

    Our story revolved around a cute little puppy who wants to join canine university to be a very well trained southeastern guide dog.

    We found out that our protagonist is very little in size but want to be as mighty as his role model Ace who is always on the front pages of the newspaper for his excellent service to his master and in turn the society. He is really sporty and somewhat clever. He uses his ears to show his trainer that he has reached the required height for being qualified for the training. He was beyond ordinary. He never accepted failure. He use to motivate himself by giving himself a reference that the same problems were once faced by his role model, but he had no idea how he managed to overcome his problems. Our puppy also knew his problems. he just used his brain and figured out smart solutions for himself.

    His story also depicts luck, opportunity and how the plane of time can change anything for an individual. Our protagonist could have no way entered the institute if his luck have not favoured him. But at times luck may even be cruel. He failed in the examinations despite putting in hard and genuine efforts. But time also made the game even as it was timed planned, the old blind lady appeared and he was shortest among all who could escape through the bars of the main gate.

    This story also gives us a gentle reminder of the fact that apart from all the rat races in this world any education or training has its real value when it is implemented in the real life. Our puppy is a guide dog he proved himself by showing the world though he failed in the exam, he had learned his lessons in real, as he helped the old lady in real life.
